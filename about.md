I'm a London based software developer who plays mostly with Elm, JavaScript and Haskell.

I'm [@marcelolaza](https://twitter.com/Marcelolaza) on Twitter.

I mostly write about easy things, like programming and algorithms, but sometimes I like to write about really hard stuff like life and people. For these days I have [It's all about focus](http://itsallaboutfocus.com/).

Here are a couple of cool projects I am working on; contributions are very welcome.

## [Silver Magpie](https://lazamar.co.uk/silver-magpie/)

A clean and beautiful Twitter client for Google Chrome written entirely in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)

## [Dict Parser](https://github.com/lazamar/dict-parser)

Create a fast parser to match dictionary keys in Elm.
