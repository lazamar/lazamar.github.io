I'm a developer. The web is my playground and JavaScript is my favourite toy.

I'm a Pebble fan and proud owner of a [Kickstarter Pebble Time](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises). I developed some watchfaces for it and if you have one too you may like them.

- [Matrix](http://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/55ad3d946749cded0f000098)
- [Percentage](http://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/55ad34495ce176822500008c)

They are open source so if you'd like to see what's going on at the backstage you can go [here](https://github.com/lazamar/Matrix-Watchface) and [here](https://github.com/lazamar/Percentage-Watchface).

I'm [@marcelolaza](https://twitter.com/Marcelolaza) on Twitter and [+Marcelo Lazaroni](https://plus.google.com/101035105630256214146) on Google+.

I mostly write about easy things, like programming and algorithms, but sometimes I like to write about really hard stuff like life and people. For these days I have [It's all about focus](http://itsallaboutfocus.com/).

Here are a couple of cool projects I am working on; contributions are very welcome.

## [Home-CI](https://github.com/lazamar/home-ci)

A home-made continuous integration system. A bare-bones application to test your
private repositories in your own server when you push to github.

## [Silver Magpie](https://lazamar.co.uk/silver-magpie/)

A clean and beautiful Twitter client for Google Chrome written entirely in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)

## [Archimedes](https://github.com/lazamar/Archimedes)

A Smart Mirror for the Internet of Things. Using NodeJs and Electron, Archimedes is voice controlled
assistant that lives behind a mirror's surface.
